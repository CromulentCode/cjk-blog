## ダンジョン飯
Ok, I know this is a show about eating food in a dungeon, but I still gotta ask: who let 'em cook? I've always been a sucker for the fantasy genre ever since I was a little kid, but it feels like all of the shows follow the same old formula now. Don't get me wrong, I do also like those shows, but even my favorite foods become a little less exciting if I eat them again and again. Luckily, this dungeon is blessed with a plethora of dangerous but tasty mobs always lurking just around the corner.

 Honestly, if I was in that dungeon I'd have no idea how to turn the oftentimes grotesque beings into something appetizing, and I think the same thing goes for most of the cast, which is why it's a good thing that they have a culinary magician accompanying them on the journey, cooking up interesting dishes for us each episode.
Always the typical 
Just a mixing and matching of tropes in the same worlds.
